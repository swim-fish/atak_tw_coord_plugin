# Specification Quality Checklist: Search & Storage Page UI Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- The spec deliberately treats `docs/design/search_settings/` as authoritative
  *design input* (the redesign was already worked out concretely there) while
  keeping the spec body itself behaviour-focused. Component names like
  "scope control", "township chooser", and "overflow menu" are user-facing UI
  concepts, not implementation bindings.
- The SDK-sample requirement (FR-017) is phrased as a reliability/behaviour
  constraint ("dialogs appear reliably on device") rather than a code mandate,
  satisfying the no-implementation-detail rule while preserving the user's
  intent to avoid on-device debugging.
